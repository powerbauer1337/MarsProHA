# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document details the critical security fixes implemented for the MarsPro Home Assistant integration to address vulnerabilities identified in the security assessment.

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Certificate File Permissions ✅
**Issue**: Private key files had insecure permissions (644), allowing read access to other users.

**Solution**:
- Added `_check_certificate_permissions()` method in MQTT client
- Implemented permission validation for private key files
- Added warning logs for insecure permissions
- Recommended file permission: 600 (owner read/write only)

**Files Modified**:
- `mqtt_client.py`: Added certificate permission checking
- `security.py`: Added `SecurityValidator.check_file_permissions()`

### 2. Enhanced Input Validation ✅
**Issue**: Basic email and password validation was insufficient.

**Solution**:
- Implemented RFC 5322 compliant email validation
- Added comprehensive password complexity requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters, maximum 128 characters
  - Must contain 3 of 4 character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
  - Blocks common weak passwords
- Added input length limits and validation patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `config_flow.py`: Enhanced validation functions
- `const.py`: Added validation constants and patterns

### 3. JSON Input Sanitization ✅
**Issue**: No size limits or validation on JSON input could lead to DoS attacks.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `_sanitize_json_input()` with 1MB size limit
- Added recursive data structure validation with depth protection (max 10 levels)
- Limited array sizes to 1000 items
- String length limits of 10,000 characters
- Key validation and dangerous key filtering
- Protection against prototype pollution

**Files Modified**:
- `mqtt_client.py`: Added JSON sanitization methods
- `const.py`: Added size limit constants

### 4. MQTT Topic Sanitization ✅
**Issue**: MQTT topics were not validated, allowing potential injection attacks.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `_validate_topic()` with regex pattern matching
- Added topic length limits (256 characters)
- Device ID and User ID validation with alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen only
- Protection against dangerous topic patterns ($SYS, $share, $queue)
- Path traversal prevention (.., leading/trailing slashes)

**Files Modified**:
- `mqtt_client.py`: Added topic and ID validation methods
- `const.py`: Added validation patterns

### 5. Secure Logging Implementation ✅
**Issue**: Potential credential leakage in log files.

**Solution**:
- Created `SecurityValidator.sanitize_log_data()` to remove sensitive data
- Implemented email masking for logs
- Added sensitive key detection (password, secret, key, token, etc.)
- Created `SecureLogger` wrapper class for automatic sanitization
- Redacted potentially sensitive strings in logs

**Files Modified**:
- `mqtt_client.py`: Added secure logging methods
- `config_flow.py`: Implemented email masking in logs
- `security.py`: Created comprehensive security utilities
- `const.py`: Added sensitive keys list

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing Checklist
1. **Input Validation Testing**
   - [ ] Test oversized JSON payloads (>1MB)
   - [ ] Test malformed email addresses
   - [ ] Test weak passwords
   - [ ] Test invalid MQTT topics

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - [ ] Test with invalid credentials
   - [ ] Test password complexity enforcement
   - [ ] Test certificate authentication

3. **Authorization Testing**
   - [ ] Test topic access controls
   - [ ] Test device ID validation
   - [ ] Test user ID validation

4. **Data Validation Testing**
   - [ ] Test JSON injection attempts
   - [ ] Test MQTT topic injection
   - [ ] Test oversized data structures

5. **Logging Security Testing**

   - [ ] Verify sensitive data sanitization

## Deployment Considerations

### Certificate Management

# MarsPro Reverse Engineering & Home Assistant Integration Development Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for reverse engineering the MarsPro mobile application and creating a Home Assistant integration for MarsPro smart gardening devices. The integration will use MQTT with certificate-based authentication to communicate with the devices.

## Current Status
- ✅ APK decompiled using APKTool
- ✅ Certificates extracted (CA, client certificate, private key)
- ✅ MQTT broker identified (emqx-marspro.lgledsolutions.com:8883)
- ✅ Home Assistant integration framework created
- ✅ MQTT client with certificate authentication implemented
- ✅ Basic entity platforms (light, sensor, fan, switch) implemented

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Validation
**Goal**: Verify all tools and certificates are working correctly

**Tasks**:
1. Verify JADX installation and fix if needed
2. Test certificate files for validity
3. Verify MQTT broker connectivity with extracted certificates
4. Set up Home Assistant development environment
5. Install integration in Home Assistant test instance

**Deliverables**:
- Working JADX installation
- Certificate validation report
- MQTT connectivity test results
- Home Assistant test environment

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis
**Goal**: Extract additional information from the APK

**Tasks**:
1. Analyze smali code for MQTT topic structure
2. Identify device control commands and parameters
3. Extract device configuration and state messages
4. Document API endpoints and data structures
5. Identify any encryption or obfuscation methods

**Deliverables**:
- Detailed MQTT topic documentation
- Device command reference
- Data structure documentation
- Security analysis report

### Phase 3: Integration Enhancement
**Goal**: Improve and complete the Home Assistant integration

**Tasks**:
1. Implement missing device types (camera, number platforms)
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement device discovery mechanism
4. Add configuration options for advanced features
5. Implement real-time status updates

**Deliverables**:
- Complete Home Assistant integration
- Device discovery implementation
- Configuration flow enhancements
- Real-time update mechanism

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Goal**: Ensure the integration works reliably

**Tasks**:
1. Unit tests for all integration components
2. Integration tests with MQTT broker
3. End-to-end testing with actual devices
4. Performance testing under various conditions
5. Security testing and validation

**Deliverables**:
- Test suite with coverage report
- Integration test results
- Performance benchmarks
- Security validation report

### Phase 5: Documentation & Release
**Goal**: Prepare for community release

**Tasks**:
1. Create comprehensive user documentation
2. Write installation and configuration guides
3. Create troubleshooting documentation
4. Prepare HACS submission
5. Create example automations and configurations

**Deliverables**:
- User documentation
- Installation guide
- Troubleshooting guide
- HACS submission package
